# urlencode-as3

Actionscript library to handle percent encoding/decoding.

# Description

I often encounter a situation where percent encoding is done in the
charset other than UTF-8 ouside of actionscript(especially at server side), 
and built-in methods like escape/unescape or
escapeMultiByte/unecapeMutliByte doesn't help since they only support UTF-8 or
charset specified in System.useCodePage.

# Usage
